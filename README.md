# Nashville City Cemetery Marketing Research
*3-6 minute  read*
## Overview
This is the repo for a project in which I poked through the burial records from the Nashville City Cemetery in order to pull out interesting, macabre, or unexpected data stories to use in marketing materials. I ended up creating several different kinds of marketing materials, everything from what I envision as a bus ad to an online dial-a-year cause-of-death predicter in the style of Buzzfeed's "which _____ was popular the year you were born?" quizzes. Also included are several charts that could be helpful in creating additional ads.

## Project Takeaways
In terms of tech, this was an Excel project, so pivot tables became not only helpful, but lifesaving! This was a great dataset to grow confidence with pivot tables and their attentive tools.
This was also an amazing experience in how "dirty" data can still be beautiful! This set required so much cleaning, but even the raw state of data was instructive! It was fascinating, for example, to see "consumption" turn into "tuberculosis", the name of disease evolving as medical understanding and research became more precise. It's really a  data story in itself!

## The Pitch
The Nashville City Cemetery Association has asked you to explore the dataset to create charts that can be used in marketing materials. You may create actual ads, but they *must* contain charts or plots.
## The Data
The burial records for the Cemetery are publicly available between 1846 and 1979.This is by far the dirtiest dataset I have ever seen, but in the most interesting way imaginable. It is filled with spelling errors, missing fields, and the evidence of the evolution of medical thought. Cleaning fully is probably the work of years, and I had a week.
## Approach to the Problem
I prioritized efficiency in cleaning my data: I had to work carefully to clean the things I wanted to investigate further without bunny-trailing myself into missing the deadline. Even so, I spent a lot of time in cleaning up my dataset... mostly normalizing disease names. For example: pneumonia was spelled at least 17 different ways. Did I want to track down every different colloquialism for "flu" and change it for a more accurate count, or keep them separate to show historical understanding of the disease? What was more interesting, common causes of death or bizarre ones?    
Pivot tables were deeply helpful, enabling me to save a ton of time while targeting specific areas of the data. Here are some of the things I looked at:
 - 10 most common (known) recorded causes of death

 - Number of burials per year. In what years were there the most burials? Why?

 - Examine deaths for each decade beginning with the 1850s. Look at the total number of deaths and the proportion of male deaths to female deaths.

 - How did age at time of death change over time?

 - Examine burials by month. Are there months with higher burials? What are the top five causes of death for each month?

 - What are the most common last names of people buried in this cemetery?

 - Any celebrities buried in the cemetery?

 - Any interesting patterns regarding where (Section/Lot) people were buried?

Not all of these questions and charts made it into my final product. Some I didn't think compelling as marketing materials or attractive enough to show off, even if they were very interesting.
